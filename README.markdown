# RoboShell Backup

RoboShell Backup is a simple personal backup tool.  
It uses Microsoft's [RoboCopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy) to copy files, and it is written in [Windows PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell).

## What does it do?

*TODO*

## How to install?

In order to use RoboShell Backup, you need to have RoboCopy and Windows Powershell installed and in your %PATH% variable.
Depending on your Windows version, this may already be the case.

The installation itself is easy.
Just create a folder on your local machine and copy the RoboShell Backup files into it.
Then, change the values in the **config.xml** according to your settings (which folders to backup, drive letters of your NAS and your USB drive).

For more information on the installation (and how to get RoboCopy and Windows PowerShell if it's not already on your machine), see the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/christianspecht/roboshell-backup/wiki/Install).
